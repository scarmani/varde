# READ THIS FILE FIRST AFTER ANY COMPACTION OR RESTART

## Mission

Execute the approved computer-only Varde ruleset evaluation from frozen source
through calibration, survivor health/depth screens, adversarial search where
feasible, and honest evidence publication. Never turn computer play into a
claim of human emergence or beauty.

## Run Control

- Run mode: finite
- Stop policy: all feasible computer-only gates complete, or genuine blocker
- User authorization: merge reviewed PR #12, then execute all recommended
  computer-resource steps in evidence-led order
- Branch: `codex/ruleset-evidence-run`
- Collision tripwire/base: `565c08b0b0dae0ba3b9ec5bbdbd3ab8927cced6b`
- PR policy: open early; user reviews and merges the evidence PR
- Merge authorization: applied to reviewed PR #12 only; never merge this run's PR
- Time allocation: implement 20%, validate 40%, review/evidence audit 40%
- Runaway threshold: five edits to one file without meaningful progress

## Non-Negotiables

- Freeze every experimental configuration before inspecting its outcomes.
- No rules or evaluator changes inside a measurement round.
- No live-game watchdog or action ceiling.
- No deletion, weakening or skipping of tests.
- No balance/depth claim from fewer than 100 games or one agent family.
- No emergence/elegance/beauty claim from computer evidence.
- Preserve all negative, illegal, crash, watchdog and incomplete accounting.
- Raw runs live outside the repository; only compact manifests/summaries enter Git.
- No force push, destructive Git operation or automatic PR merge.

## Current Phase

Status: in progress

Active batch: Batch 1 — timing and immutable calibration manifest

Just completed: CLI and timing feasibility audit; frozen manifest and its
contract test pass locally with 202 total tests.

Single next action: commit and push the frozen manifest, wait for exact-head CI,
then launch A-uniform-250 from a detached worktree at that commit.

## Active Compute

None. The canceled timing-only sample produced no completed record; its outputs
were removed and no outcome was inspected.

## Stop Gate

- Planned batches remaining: 5
- Stop allowed right now: no
- Next required action: commit the manifest and launch Stage A only after CI

## Validation Gates

- `pytest -q -o addopts=''`
- `python3 -m py_compile engine/*.py research/harness/*.py`
- `node --check web/game.js`
- Harness-specific deterministic/checkpoint tests
- Exact manifest/hash validation before each launch
- PR comments and checks after every push

## Recovery Order

Read this guide, `.elves-session.json`,
`docs/elves/ruleset-evaluation-learnings.md`,
`docs/plans/ruleset-computer-evaluation-run.md`, and
`docs/elves/ruleset-evidence-execution-log.md`. Reconcile active processes and
output checkpoints before launching or resuming any compute.
